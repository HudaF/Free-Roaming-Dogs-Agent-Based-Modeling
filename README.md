Agent Based Model - Vaccination and Neutering: Methods to Control Urban Stray Dog Populations and Rabies-Spread Among Humans
=============

## About the Project:

The purpose of this model is to show that vaccination and neutering is a more effective method of controlling urban free-roaming dog populations, and of containing the spread of canine-transmitted rabies among the urban human population, in the long-term. This will hopefully show evidence against the prevalent inhumane practice of mass cullings of free-roaming dogs in Pakistan, which is a practice that dominates the policy dialogue and represents general public perceptions. 

## Software and Packages used:
For modelling purposes **NetLogo 6.1.1** has been used.
