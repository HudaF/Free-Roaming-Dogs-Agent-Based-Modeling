Agent-Based-Modeling of Free Roaming Dogs in Karachi
=============

## About the Project:

The purpose of this project is to model and simulate that vaccination and neutering is a more effective method of controlling urban free-roaming dog populations, and of containing the spread of canine-transmitted rabies among the urban human population, in the long-term. The project explores evidence against the prevalent inhumane practice of mass cullings of free-roaming dogs, which is a practice that dominates the policy dialogue and represents general public perceptions.

## Software and Packages used:
For modelling purposes **NetLogo 6.1.1** has been used.
